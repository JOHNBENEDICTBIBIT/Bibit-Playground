No I don't really wanna do too much, she could be losing her
Touch
Yeah I think we've been fucking too much
Floating again, watching the smoke in the clouds
I just like smoking it loud
She with the king of the south, she got my dick in her mouth
We just might do it again
Pass me the hit, waste no time like the moonlight with your friends
She come to the bassline for something
I could really do this all morning
I equalize, equalize all your pressure baby
Equalize, equalize all your pressure baby
Bite into your skin, I could movе your bones, that's no lie
Deadly on your sin, pull my еyes again, said I might (break, break)
Don't you test me, said I'm losing out
Shit is the same, know that we're overdue

[Chorus: Fern]
Trip on LSD dizzy, I smoke on cigarettes breezy
She got a lot on her mind, I need to get on the line
Trip on LSD dizzy, I smoke on cigarettes breezy
She got no presence of mind, I got no essence of time

[Verse 2: Obi, Sonny Zero]
This shit feel like danger (Yes it does, yeah, yeah, yes it does)
The things I like to do
That is not my tincture (yes it is, yeah, yes it is)
I'm kinda lost in this
Fuck it I be off and on the molly I be chilling with my shawty And she take another pill
Doin my shit I'm in love with the thrill
I hop in the cab and I throw in some bills
Take me anywhere and roll the windows down a bit
'Cause she say R.I.P. to me in living how again
No, no, no
Money pussy power be the only things that matter
Wifey by my side yeah you know that she be badder
Flying through the sky, know I'm smoking on some shatter
That boy he a lie, swear to god I'll never cap yeah


[Verse 3: Moses, Fern]
Oh shit that's on me, bruh I said I was tryna, go clean
Least we ain't on E, but we poppin' the M's like ollies
Damn, these bitches be fans I'm probably
Way too smooth with it my demeanor got that cool rhythm
Last night couldn't feel myself from the waist up
Momma groovin' her hips on me tryna say sum
Wouldn't remember cause I was way too wasted
Let the film roll autopilot when I'm cross
Faded babe
Then I woke up, we were all alone in my pad
I had a handful of that ass
Slurring my words you started to laugh
Gave me a kiss and a tab then it all just shifted like that

[Chorus: Fern]
I trip on LSD dizzy, I smoke on cigarettes breezy
She got a lot on her mind, I need to get on the line
I trip on LSD dizzy, I smoke on cigarettes breezy
She got no presence of mind, I got no essence of time

[Outro: Punzie]
Sudden realization, no question
I don't really want your number, you feel that?
Heavy intoxication, ascension, I don't really want your number Sudden realization no question
I don't really want your number, you feel that?
Heavy intoxication, ascension
I don't really want your number, you feel that?
